### Sensible macOS defaults
When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible macOS defaults:
Iterm theme is just installed, you have to select it mannually

```bash
./.macos
```


When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
./brew.sh
```
